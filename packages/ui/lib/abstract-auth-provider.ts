   *  function in https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils, if you
   *  are using the standard account signing interface in your network/blockchain.
   *  If you are using a standard interface and it doesn't exist in js-3id-blockchain-utils,
   *  please open an issue there, so we can add shared support for your network.
